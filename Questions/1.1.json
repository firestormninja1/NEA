        "feedback": "- Each core of a CPU can execute its own independent Fetch Decode Execute (FDE) cycle; increasing the number of cores can increase the amount of simultaneous FDE cycles executed to enhance processing power. \\n - Another way to increase processing power is by increasing the clock speed. The clock speed is the time taken for one FDE cycle to complete, so by increasing this it results in more FDE cycles being completed per specified time frame. \\n - Increasing the Cache memory is also another option to improve CPU performance. Cache memory is the CPU's onboard memory. Instructions fetched from main memory are copied to the cache so if required again, they can be accessed quicker. As cache fills up, unused instructions are replaced. ",
